# Proposed New Features for Deal AI Workspace

## Feature: AI-Powered Transcript Q&A and Analysis

**Core Concept:** Enable users to ask natural language questions about the content of transcripts associated with a deal. The system will use the transcript data as context for an LLM to generate answers and insights.

**Key Capabilities:**

- An interface (e.g., a chat input within the deal view or a dedicated Q&A section) for users to submit questions.
- The system will gather the text from all (or selected) transcripts for the current deal.
- This transcript data will be provided as context to an LLM, along with the user's question as a prompt.
- The LLM will generate an answer or analysis based solely on the provided transcript context.
- Ability to potentially highlight or reference parts of the transcript(s) that informed the AI's answer (if feasible with the chosen LLM and prompting strategy).

**User Value:** Drastically reduces time spent manually searching through transcripts, allows users to quickly extract specific information, understand key themes, or recall past discussion points by directly querying the call content via an AI.

## Feature: Deal Contact Management

**Core Concept:** Introduce a system for creating, managing, and associating contact persons with specific deals.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Create new contact records with fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, and Job Title.
- Link multiple contacts to a single deal, potentially with a "role" on the deal (e.g., Decision Maker, Influencer).
- View associated contacts directly from the deal detail page.

**User Value:** Centralizes crucial stakeholder information, facilitates targeted communication, and lays the groundwork for future integrations (e.g., email, calendar).

## Feature: Email Integration & Intelligence (Phased Approach)

**Core Concept:** Connect with users' Gmail (and potentially other email providers) to bring email communication context into the Deal AI Workspace.

**Key Capabilities (Phase 1 - Last Correspondence):**

- Securely authenticate with user's Gmail account (OAuth).
- For contacts associated with a deal, display the date of the last email exchange.

**Key Capabilities (Phase 2 - Email Content Ingestion & Analysis):**

- Pull in relevant email thread content associated with deal contacts.
- Store or reference email data securely.
- Utilize email content as an additional data source for AI analysis, summarization, and Q&A (in conjunction with transcripts).

**User Value:** Provides a more holistic view of deal communications within the platform, reduces context switching, and enriches the data available for AI-powered insights.

## Feature: AI-Driven Pricing Proposal Generation

**Core Concept:** An AI-powered tool that analyzes a deal's transcript(s) to identify discussions around pricing, product/service configurations, or agreed-upon terms, and then generates a draft pricing proposal.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Dedicated button/action within the transcript viewer or deal detail page.
- AI analysis of transcript content to extract pricing-related information.
- Generation of a structured pricing proposal (e.g., as a text artifact, or a new "Proposal" artifact type).
- Allow user review and editing of the generated proposal.

**User Value:** Accelerates the proposal creation process, ensures proposals are grounded in actual conversations, and can help standardize proposal formats.

## Feature: Intelligent Action Item Management

**Core Concept:** A dynamic to-do list system integrated within each deal, with tasks suggested by AI and manageable by the user.

**Key Capabilities:**

- AI analysis of transcripts (and potentially emails later) to automatically suggest action items (e.g., "Follow up on X," "Send Y document").
- UI to display these tasks within the deal context.
- User ability to manually create, edit, and delete tasks.
- Ability to mark tasks as complete (with visual feedback, e.g., strikethrough).
- Persistence of task status.

**User Value:** Helps users stay organized, ensures follow-ups are not missed, and provides a clear overview of next steps for each deal.

## Feature: AI Sales Engagement Planner

**Core Concept:** An AI tool that analyzes the current deal context (stage, transcript insights, contact roles) and generates a recommended sequence of sales touchpoints for the near future.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Button/action to trigger engagement plan generation.
- AI generation of a 2-3 step outreach plan (e.g., "Day 1: Send personalized summary email," "Day 3: Call to discuss [key point]," "Day 5: Share relevant case study").
- Suggestions for message themes or content for each touchpoint.

**User Value:** Provides proactive strategic guidance, helps reps plan effective follow-up cadences, and can improve engagement consistency.

## Feature: AI Deal Health & Sentiment Analysis

**Core Concept:** AI-driven analysis to provide a qualitative assessment of a deal's current status, momentum, and prospect sentiment, complementing formal CRM stages.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Analysis of transcript content (and later, email data) for sentiment, engagement cues, and potential risks.
- Display of a deal health indicator (e.g., "Strong Interest," "Needs Nurturing," "At Risk," "Stalled").
- Potentially, a summary of reasons behind the assessment.

**User Value:** Offers a quick, data-driven pulse check on deals, helping sales reps and managers prioritize efforts and identify deals requiring immediate attention or a change in strategy.

## Feature: Integrated Meeting Scheduler

**Core Concept:** Allow users to create and send calendar invitations directly from the Deal AI Workspace, linking them to specific deals and contacts.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Integration with user's primary calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar via APIs).
- Ability to pre-fill invitation details (attendees, deal context) based on selected contacts and deal information.
- Send calendar invitations to specified email addresses.

**User Value:** Streamlines the meeting scheduling workflow, reduces manual data entry, and keeps meeting context tied to the deal.

## Feature: Automated Prospect Intelligence Briefings

**Core Concept:** An AI agent that proactively researches relevant public information (news, industry updates, company announcements) about a prospect or their company, based on deal details.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Utilize deal information (prospect company name, industry, product/service interest) as research inputs.
- Automated querying of news APIs or targeted web searches.
- AI-powered filtering and summarization of relevant findings.
- Presentation of these "intelligence briefings" to the user within the deal context.

**User Value:** Equips sales reps with timely and pertinent information to personalize conversations, demonstrate industry awareness, and identify new value propositions or talking points.
